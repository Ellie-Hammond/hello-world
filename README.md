First repository for GitHub Flow practice 
Hi! My name is Ellie Hammond, and I recently started as a GIS Analyst for the City of Tucson's Office of Equity. I am originally from Flagstaff, Arizona, where I grew up as an avid hiker, skier, and swimmer. I am looking forward to learning more about the world of open-source GIS and graduating from the GIST program.
